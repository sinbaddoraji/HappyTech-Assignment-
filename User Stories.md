software that adjusts to my different applications.

As a reviewer member, I want to manipulate the templates so I can adjust it to
my application needs.

that we have only what we need.

As reviewers, we deal with too many applications so we would like to send
feedback in an automatic way so all applicants receive it.

As head office, we would want the software to be easy to use and understand
so that we donâ€™t know to be asking for help or call for maintenance if we have
any problem.

As a reviewer, I would like to have easy ways to edit my form and correct
mistakes so that if for example I delete something by mistake I can have it
back.
